# How Did
**Author:** Konrad Swierczek

A repository of scripts for doing setup/configuration/one-time tasks that don't make it into project repositories. The title is a play on "How To": I don't see these files as a series of "How To's" or tutorials or gists, but a way of keeping track of all these tasks for when I inevitably need to do them again, and don't remember how. If these can also help other folks, even better!

These are generally written in bash, but some might be for other shells/languages. Each file should start with documentation.
